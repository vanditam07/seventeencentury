# LoginApp

A simple Flutter login application using Firebase authentication. This project is designed to demonstrate how to integrate Firebase authentication with a mobile app to allow users to sign up, log in, and manage their session.

## Features

- **User Authentication**  
  Users can register and log in using email and password.
  
- **Firebase Integration**  
  The app uses Firebase for user authentication, making it easy to manage users and handle sign-in/sign-up logic.

- **Responsive UI**  
  The app features a modern, responsive UI design, optimized for both mobile and tablet devices.

## Technologies Used

- **Flutter:** For building the mobile app UI and logic.
- **Firebase Authentication:** For user sign-up and login functionality.
- **Firebase:** For cloud-based backend services.
- **Dart:** Programming language used for Flutter development.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vanditam07/LoginApp.git
cd LoginApp
```

### 2. Set up Firebase

1. Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
2. Create a new Firebase project.
3. Add Firebase to your Flutter app by following the instructions in the Firebase console for Flutter.
4. Enable Firebase Authentication in the Firebase console (Email/Password method).
5. Add the necessary Firebase configuration files to your Flutter project.

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install the necessary packages for Flutter:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### 4. Run the App

Run the app on an emulator or a real device:

```bash
flutter run
```

The app should now be running on `http://localhost:8080` or your emulator/device.

## How It Works

1. **Login and Sign Up:**  
   - Users can create a new account using their email and password or log in if they already have an account.
   
2. **Firebase Authentication:**  
   - Firebase handles the authentication process, including email verification and password hashing.

3. **User Session:**  
   - Once logged in, the user can stay authenticated until they log out. The app manages the user session using Firebase authentication.
